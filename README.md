Just walked outta Nonnas, feel like my brain’s been put through a blender. My back is killing me from those chairs, you know how they are. Popcorn bits stuck to my jeans. Kept thinking the whole way, why do theaters not clean better mid-screening?

Anyway, Nonnas was, wow, just, I dunno, like diving into a surreal family soup. There’s that scene with the old lady, stirring the pot, reminded me of my grandma, but then she says something about life being like pasta, and I’m like, pasta? Really? And suddenly I’m craving spaghetti in my seat. Crazy how movies do that.

> Oh, and the soundtrack! Like a pigeon trapped in a flute, bizarre yet somehow fitting, echoes bouncing around like, I dunno, my mind at 3 a.m. One scene just had someone folding laundry, not even saying anything, and yet it felt like they were unraveling the secrets of the universe—wild, wild stuff. 

The theater was toasty, people coughing around like it’s an orchestra of sniffles, maybe ‘cause of the emotions? Makes you think about allergies in cinemas. Then, midway through, someone dropped a slushy, adding to the chaos with this sticky waterfall scene on the floor. Felt like I was sitting in a circus.

Somebody told me, “Hey, download the movie,” but there’s just stuff you gotta watch the movie to get. Like, you’ve gotta let it seep into your bones with everyone around reacting, gasping. Oh, the part with the giant meatball…theater roared with laughter. Can’t imagine that hitting the same at home.

Isn’t it strange how one minute you’re laughing, and the next, it’s like a fog of melancholy rolls in? Feels like life sometimes, except life doesn’t come with subtitles or popcorn. Nonna’s a wild ride, like a bear on a unicycle– it shouldn’t work, but somehow, it just does.
